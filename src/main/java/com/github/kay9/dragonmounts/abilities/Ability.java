/**
 * Each ability type has its own number of factories. One type can have multiple factories
 * to specify behavior.
 * Factories create instances that are unique to each dragon entity
 * this is due to the fact that sometimes an ability needs entity-specific actions,
 * and sometimes we don't (so we memoize the instance instead of making dozens of copies)
 * For example:
 *  - Ability X is defined in the datapack to place blocks in Y radius for Dragon Breed A.
 *  - Ability X is defined in the datapack to place blocks in Z radius for Dragon Breed B.
 *  - Ability X also requires a cooldown timer that has to be specific to each entity.
 *  Breed A has:
 *   - Ability X:
 *      - final int radius = Y; // finals are Breed Specific variables
 *      - int cooldown = 50 // other variables are Dragon-entity specific.
 *  Breed B has:
 *   - Ability X:
 *      - final int radius = Z;
 *      - int cooldown = 1000
 *  <br>
 *  Same ability type, different constants, instance-based variables.
 *  <br>
 *  If the ability DOES NOT require per-entity data, it may be better to off to implement {@link Factory} directly and
 *  return itself.

     * a new factory type instance that just returns a new 'effective singleton', which is unnecessary for memory.
     * Most abilities in DML are simplistic in nature and follow this approach. {@link FrostWalkerAbility} is a good
     * example.

     * you override {@link Factory#create} and {@link Factory#type}. <br>
     * If the parent ability class is a breed specific type, and your type is an entity specific, {@link Factory#create} and

     * implementations, or use {@link Ability#simpleFactory}
